opengroupware.org (1.0a.8-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial Release of converted sources. Upstream has done heavy
    restructuring of the sources, see also the SOPE changelog for details.
  * All OpenGroupware.org servers now log to syslog. This also works around
    the former incapability to rotate logs.
