opengroupware.org (1.0a.9-0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Replaced previous autoconfiguration stuff with new ogo-create-instance
    script (in opengroupware.org-environment). This script enables
    administrators to set up multiple instances of OpenGroupware.org possibly
    even running different versions (if installed).
  * New init script handles now all daemons and is able to start multiple
    instances of OpenGroupware.org.
