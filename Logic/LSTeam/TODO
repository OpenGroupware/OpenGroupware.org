LSGetTeamsForGlobalIDsCommand.m
- contains *two* variants of the command? Who did that and what is it good 
  for? Moved the "old" variant to a separate file which may be deleted if it 
  isn't required anymore.

  - [jr]: don`t now, whether the code was commented out instead of deleting it,
          but I think the old version can be deleted

LSCheckPermissionCompanyCommand.m
- this is basically commented out. Why? Who did that? (last committer is Jan)
  
  - [jr]: very old code ;) -  the access handling will be done by access 
          handler (implemented in DocumentAPI)

LSResolveAccountsCommand
- mapped to two commands:
  team::resolveaccounts
  team::expand
