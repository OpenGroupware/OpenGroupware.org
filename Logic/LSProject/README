LSProject
=========

LSProject is a pretty large command bundle and should be really split into
separate ones.

Besides the management of the "project" entity, it contains the commands used
to handle:
- (DB) documents
- jobs
- notes
- associations to contacts


project::get-comment is called in:
WebUI/Project/LSWProject/LSWProjectViewer.m
WebUI/Project/LSWProject/LSWProjectEditor.m
WebUI/Project/LSWProject/SkyProjectInlineViewer.m
