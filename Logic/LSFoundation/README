Access Rules (TODO: translate to English)
============
(by JR)

access permissions for persons / accounts / companies


- root is always allowed to do everything

- if nothing is set, everyone may read and write. As soon as an ACL is
  set on an object, access is forbidden for everyone who is not listed

- everyone who has write access may set the ACL.
- you cannot remove permissions from the owner.

When read permissions are lacked the objects won't be fetched. This way it can
happen that there are appointments without participants.

The permissions are checked in the command objects, due to this it can happen
that edit forms can be reached (due to still available buttons) but that a
save fails due to missing permissions.
=> TODO: this would be a bug

IsReadOnly/IsPrivate are overridden in case an ACL is set.

The own account record can always be read/written.
