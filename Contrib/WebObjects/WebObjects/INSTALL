MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED!
=============================

Because I have not found a way to teach Xcode to copy headers
from NGObjWeb over to this framework, you have to perform this
operation manually after installing the library.

Assuming you have installed all the frameworks in
/Library/Frameworks (the default), this goes like this:

$ cd /Library/Frameworks/WebObjects.framework/Headers
$ ln -s /Library/Frameworks/NGObjWeb.framework/Headers/WO* .
