Overview over OpenGroupware.org Sourcecode Repository
=====================================================

The source repository contains several top-level project directories. In
each of the the directories you will find a "PROJECTLEAD" file which
contains the email address of the person maintaining the subsection. So
if you have any questions, feel free to contact the maintainer.

Note that you have to build the packages in a proper order, see the build
howto on http://www.opengroupware.org/.

Database
========
[required]

- contains SQL schema for the storage backend and the model required
  to map SQL records to objects

ThirdParty
==========
[required]

Snapshots of ThirdParty software required to build OpenGroupware.org.

SOPE
====
[required]

The OpenGroupware.org application server.
- basic libraries for HTML, HTTP, IMAP4, XML, LDAP, ... processing

Logic
=====
[required]

The business logic of OpenGroupware.org. If you trigger functionality using
Logic commands instead of direct SQL, all permissions etc will be ensured. For
example the appointment::fetch command will only return appointment information
you have access to.

DocumentAPI
===========
[required]

- a wrapper which puts the Document/DataSource/FileManager abstraction on top 
  of Logic
- this is used mainly by the WebUI and the XmlRpcAPI

WebUI
=====
[recommended]

The primary HTML user-interface of OpenGroupware.org. You can find the main
executable in OpenGroupware.org/WebUI/OpenGroupware.org/OpenGroupware.woa.

Themes
======
[recommended]

The images of the WebUI are kept in a separate directory to reduce CVS
load during updates.

XmlRpcAPI
=========
[recommended]

Contains the daemon (and later client libraries) to access the 
OpenGroupware.org functionality using XML-RPC.

ZideStore
=========
[recommended]

ZideStore adds WebDAV, iCalendar/HTTP and WCAP protocols to the 
OpenGroupware.org server and is used to connect native clients like
Glow or Apple iCal.app.

AdminUI
=======
[optional]

The AdminUI contains generators for various standard Unix files, like
Postfix virtual files. The generation is (usually) done based on the
OGo account database.

PDA
===
[optional]

Contains the daemons and applications required to sync OpenGroupware.org with
Palm devices.

SandStorm
=========
[experimental]

Several XML-RPC daemons put together using the SandStorm protocol and
the associated registry.

Publisher
=========
[experimental]

This is a simple extension to OGo projects which allow you to implemented
template driven exports of static HTML servers.
Suitable for smaller webservers (exports take a long time), also used for 
the www.opengroupware.org website :-)
