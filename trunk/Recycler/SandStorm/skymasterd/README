One daemon to rule them all...

This daemon controls all the other programs used within a SKYRiX environment.
After being properly configured, it is the only daemon that has to be started
in order to get a working SKYRiX/SandStorm environment.
It automagically registers at a started registry if this registry has the
taskclass 'RegistryTask'. Re-registering at the given interval is done, too.

See INSTALL for installation instructions and TROUBLESHOOTING for help
if something doesn't work the way it is intented to do.

Access Control
==============
The following methods don't require authentication:
  - tasks
  - templates
  - isRunning
  - status
  - all introspection API methods

All other functions require valid credentials, check the INSTALL document
for setting them up.
