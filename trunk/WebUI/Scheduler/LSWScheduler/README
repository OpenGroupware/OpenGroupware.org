LSWScheduler
============

This contains "pretty old" components, coming from about SKYRiX 3.5. Since some
of them are pretty complex and hard to rewrite from scratch, they are still
used ;-)
One limitation is that most of the components in here work on EO objects
instead of GID commands.


NOTES
=====

SkyParticipantsSelection
========================
- used in: SkyPalmPreferences, LSWAppointmentProposal, LSWSchedulerPreferences,
           LSWAppointmentEditor
- Note: LSWProjectEditor has its own mechanism for doing that ...
