WebUI
=====
[STABLE]
[REQUIRES: SOPE, GDL, Logic, DocumentAPI]

The WebUI directory contains most of the OpenGroupware.org HTML user-interface 
components. The components are packaged in UI bundles which have a .lso 
extension and are installed into $GNUSTEP_ROOT/Libary/OpenGroupware.org.

[TODO: explain more on how the architecture works ...]

Directories
===========

OpenGroupware.org
- this contains the executable binary with the entry (login) page and
  the application object

Resources
- contains all the string files for localization

OGoFoundation
- a library
- generic OpenGroupware.org objects/classes, like
  - session class
  - navigation object
  - superclasses for editors, viewers, pages
  - configuration handler
  - label processors (localization)
  - various formatters

Common: BaseUI / OGoUIElements / PropertiesUI
- components and dynamic elements used in all OpenGroupware.org apps
- BaseUI has "old-style" (3.x) components
- OGoUIElements contains more modern (4.x) elements

Mailer
- contains the bundles which form the WebMail client

Scheduler
- contains the bundles which form the scheduler application

Project
- contains the bundles which form the document management and
  project application

JobUI
- the "job" application, used to manage tasks and simple workflows

NewsUI
- the news intro page, a *really small* newsboard
- to be replaced by a "portal-style" application

PreferencesUI
- components which form the preferences application
- note that the specific preference panels are "plugged-in"
  from the application itself (eg the scheduler prefs are
  implemented in the scheduler application)

AdminUI
- the administration application
  - manages users / teams
  - license keys
  - system-wide defaults

Contact: AddressUI / EnterprisesUI / PersonsUI / LDAPAccounts
- components to edit/view/search contact information
- since both enterprises and persons are "company" objects
  (objects stored in the company table), common components
  are placed in LSWAddress

SkyForms / SkyP4Forms
- SkyForms is a library which provides form capabilities
- SkyP4Forms contains the components required to implement
  the custom form capability
