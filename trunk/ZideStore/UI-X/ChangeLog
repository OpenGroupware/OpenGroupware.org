	* Scheduler/OGoCalWeekOverview.m: moved navigation URL generation to
	  superclass (now generic because we use the 'ownMethodName'). Could
	  even be moved to OGoCalView?
	
	* Scheduler/OGoCalMonthView.m: added next/prev month URL generation
	  methods, calculate startdate from form value

	* Scheduler/OGoCalView.m: added -ownMethodName method to return the
	  last path component of the request URL (the SOPE method), eg
	  'weekoverview' for OGoCalWeekView, added 
	  -dateNavigationURLWithNewStartDate: method to calculate 'startDate'
	  URLs (should be improved to include existing query parameters!)

	* Scheduler/OGoCalWeekOverview.m: minor tweaks ;-)

	* Scheduler/OGoCalWeekOverview.m: provide URLs for switching back/forth
	  weekoverview.

	* Scheduler/OGoCalView.[hm]: methods for converting dates into strings
	  and vice versa.
