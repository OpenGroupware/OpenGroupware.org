<p>
  A small introduction on how to access XML-RPC webservices in Objective-C
  using NGXmlRpc.
</p>


<h4>The frameworks ...</h4>
<p>
  The XML-RPC support in SOPE is scattered in some frameworks (for some good
  reasons ;-)
  They are: libXmlRpc, libNGObjWeb and libNGXmlRpc.
</p>
<p>
  The XML parsing is actually done in sope-xml/XmlRpc. This library contains
  a SaxObjC handler which creates XML-RPC objects (XmlRpcRequest,
  XmlRpcResponse) and coder objects which can produce XML-RPC XML entities
  from given objects. Notably it allows arbitary objects to get encoded as
  XML-RPC requests/responses.
  <br />
  But the one thing which libXmlRpc does _not_ contain is an HTTP transport. So
  by itself it is only the parser/generator and cannot be used to perform
  actual calls.
</p>
<p>
  One option to get an HTTP transport is WORequest and WOResponse in
  conjunction with the WOHTTPConnection class as contained in libNGObjWeb.
  WOHTTPConnection is a simple HTTP client which can be used to send requests
  and receive responses. If NGStreams was compiled with SSL support (default),
  it even supports https requests.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, libNGXmlRpc ties the WOHTTPConnection and the libXmlRpc parser
  together and wraps them in an easy to use NGXmlRpcClient object.
</p>
<p>
  The "other" option: on MacOSX WOHTTPConnection is not necessarily the best
  option. With the WebKit framework Cocoa Foundation provides a pretty good
  HTTP transport which can be used in combination with libXmlRpc.
  This might be covered in a later article ;-)

<h4>Using xmlrpc_client ...</h4>
<p>
  Prior implementing an own client, you might want to try to call your
  XML-RPC service using
  <a href="http://www.opengroupware.org/en/devs/resources/xmlrpc/xmlrpc_call.html"
     >xmlrpc_call</a>.
  This is a tool implemented using NGXmlRpc to call XML-RPC from the
  commandline. As a small example to get started:
</p>
<pre>
xmlrpc_call \
  http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php \
  meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring XML.com
</pre>


<!-- ********************************************************************** -->
<h4>Calling the Meerkat service in Objective-C </h4>
<p>
  First, you need to create an instance of the NGXmlRpcClient class which
  represents a connection to some XML-RPC service. The service is specified
  as an URL which can be passed in as either a regular NSString or as an NSURL:
</p>
<pre>
NGXmlRpcClient *client;
NSString       *url;
  
url = @"http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php";
client = [[NGXmlRpcClient alloc] initWithURL:url];
</pre>
<p>
  After that we can use the object referenced by the <tt>client</tt> variable
  to call a service:
</p>
<pre>[client call:@"meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring", @"XML", nil]);</pre>
<p>
  The example uses the <tt>-call:</tt> varargs method, NGXmlRpcClient provides
  some more for more complex setups. The first argument of the method is the
  name of the XML-RPC method to be called. All additional arguments up to the
  <tt>nil</tt> terminator are passed as arguments to the remote method, in this
  case we have a single string argument, <tt>XML</tt>.
</p>
<p>
  Well, thats it! Note that you can use the <tt>client</tt> object for as many
  calls as you like, you don't need to recreate for each call.
</p>


<!-- ********************************************************************** -->
<h4>The complete function</h4>
<p>
  The whole function as called by the <tt>main()</tt> function below:
</p>
<pre>
static void runIt(void) {
  NGXmlRpcClient *client;
  NSString *url;
  
  url = @"http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php";
  client = [[NGXmlRpcClient alloc] initWithURL:url];
  
  NSLog(@"result: %@", 
	[client call:@"meerkat.getChannelsBySubstring", @"XML", nil]);

  [client release];
}
</pre>


<!-- ********************************************************************** -->
<h4>Argument Types</h4>
<p>
  XML-RPC itself supports a limited set of argument types at the protocol
  level. Those are: strings, integers, arrays, dictionaries and dates. Since
  this mostly matches what is available in Foundation property lists you might
  already have methods in your custom classes to represent them as objects
  supported by XML-RPC.
  <br />
  TODO: explain XML-RPC encoding/decoding supports for complex objects.
</p>


<!-- ********************************************************************** -->
<h4>Basic Authentication</h4>
<p>
  A lot of XML-RPC services implement an own authentication system as XML-RPC
  methods. But some - like OGo xmlrpcd, ZideStore or Zope - use the basic
  authentication builtin in HTTP.
</p>
<p>
  To pass basic auth information to the client, you can either encode the
  authentication in the URL, eg:
</p>
<pre>http://donald:secret@localhost/RPC2</pre>
<p>
  Or explicitly pass them to the object on creation:
</p>
<pre>
client = [[NGXmlRpcClient alloc] initWithURL:url 
                                 login:@"donald" password:@"secret"];
</pre>


<!-- ********************************************************************** -->
<h4>XML-RPC over Unix Sockets</h4>
<p>
  Quite rare, but some services provide XML-RPC over Unix domain sockets
  (primarily for security reasons).
  One example is the RedCarpet / OpenCarpet daemon.
</p>
<p>
  Such services can be accessed by creating a NGLocalSocketAddress
  (libNGStreams) for the service and passing that to
  <tt>-initWithRawAddress:</tt> method of NGXmlRpcClient:
</p>
<pre>
  id<NGSocketAddress> address;
  
  address = [NGLocalSocketAddress addressWithPath:@"/var/my-xmlrpc-service"];
  client  = [[NGXmlRpcClient alloc] initWithRawAddress:address];
</pre>


<!-- ********************************************************************** -->
<h4>Main function</h4>
<p>
  To complete the example you need a main function:
</p>
<pre>
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **env) {
  NSAutoreleasePool *pool;
  
  pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
#if LIB_FOUNDATION_LIBRARY || defined(GS_PASS_ARGUMENTS)
  [NSProcessInfo initializeWithArguments:argv count:argc environment:env];
#endif
  
  runIt();
  [pool release];
  return 0;
}
</pre>


<!-- ********************************************************************** -->
<h4>The GNUstep Makefile ...</h4>
<p>
  The GNUstep makefile used for building the example:
</p>
<pre>
include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/common.make

TOOL_NAME = meerkat_xml_channels

meerkat_xml_channels_OBJC_FILES += meerkat_xml_channels.m

ADDITIONAL_TOOL_LIBS += \
	-lNGXmlRpc -lNGObjWeb -lNGMime -lNGStreams -lNGExtensions -lEOControl \
	-lXmlRpc -lDOM -lSaxObjC

include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/tool.make
</pre>
<p>
  Build using <tt>make all</tt> (remember to have GNUstep.sh sourced).
</p>

<h4>More to come ...</h4>
<p>
  As mentioned in the intro, libXmlRpc and NGXmlRpc have some other nifty
  features which we left out in this short intro.
