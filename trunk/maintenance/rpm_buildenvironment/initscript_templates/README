INITSCRIPT TEMPLATES
====================

These are the initscript templates for the
various RPM based buildhosts.
We distinguish between:

  redhat_* -> initscripts which should work
              fine on `redhat` based distributions
              (Fedora/RedHat/Mandrake/Conectiva)

  suse_*   -> initscripts with extra requirements
              seen in SUSE initscripts
