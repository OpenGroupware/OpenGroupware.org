This directory contains all the necessary

 rpmmacros_trunk
 rpmmacros_release

files.

I've split them up - each buildhost gets
it's own set of macros.

'purveyor_of_rpms.pl' will link to these
files (depending on the type of build) and
the script will also update the information
provided within the rpmmacros during each
build. Thus I can use the same specfile
for different distributions (might not work
with quite old rpm based distributions).

The toplevel dir contains a template of both
files - keep it up2date everytime you add
another package or add sth new to the rpmmacros.

Don't bother if the template or even the buildhost
specific rpmmacros show a different

 %distribution

value - 'purveyor_of_rpms.pl' will fix this during
the actual build.

It's also safe to `reset` the rpmmacros. Simply
overwrite the current 'macros/${buildhost}/rpmmacros*'
file with the template (see above) or edit the
version, buildcount, release macros - 'purveyor_of_rpms.pl'
will fill in the proper values during the next build.
