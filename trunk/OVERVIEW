Overview over OpenGroupware.org Sourcecode Repository
=====================================================

The source repository contains several top-level project directories. In
each of the the directories you will find a "PROJECTLEAD" file which
contains the email address of the person maintaining the subsection. So
if you have any questions, feel free to contact the maintainer.

Note that you have to build the packages in a proper order, see the build
howto on http://www.opengroupware.org/.

Database
========
[required]

- contains SQL schema for the storage backend and the model required
  to map SQL records to objects

Logic
=====
[required]

The business logic of OpenGroupware.org. If you trigger functionality using
Logic commands instead of direct SQL, all permissions etc will be ensured. For
example the appointment::fetch command will only return appointment information
you have access to.

DocumentAPI
===========
[required]

- a wrapper which puts the Document/DataSource/FileManager abstraction on top 
  of Logic
- this is used mainly by the WebUI and the XmlRpcAPI

WebUI
=====
[recommended]

The primary HTML user-interface of OpenGroupware.org. You can find the main
executable in OpenGroupware.org/WebUI/OpenGroupware.org/OpenGroupware.woa.

Themes
======
[recommended]

The images of the WebUI are kept in a separate directory to reduce CVS
load during updates.

XmlRpcAPI
=========
[recommended]

Contains the daemon (and later client libraries) to access the 
OpenGroupware.org functionality using XML-RPC.

ZideStore
=========
[recommended]

ZideStore adds WebDAV, iCalendar/HTTP and WCAP protocols to the 
OpenGroupware.org server and is used to connect native clients like
Glow or Apple iCal.app.

PDA
===
[optional]

Contains the daemons and applications required to sync OpenGroupware.org with
Palm devices.
