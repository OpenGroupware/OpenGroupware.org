Logic
=====
[STABLE]
[REQUIRES: SOPE, GDL]

This directory contains the OpenGroupware.org business logic. The logic is
provided in terms of so called "command" objects which are packaged in
"command bundles". Command bundles have the ".cmd" extension and are installed
into "$GNUSTEP_ROOT/Library/OpenOffice.org/".
