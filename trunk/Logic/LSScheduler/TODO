TODO
====

- timeZoneDetail is not available on Cocoa Foundation - find a proper 
  replacement to avoid compilation warnings (and ensure proper function)

- cleanup LSGetAppointmentsForGlobalIDs, contains HUGE methods which need to
  be split up

- cleanup cycle date calculator API, see header

- rewrite LSGetCommentForAppointmentsCommand.m to use the adaptor and IDs
  to fetch the comments instead of the dateInfo relation

- duplicate conflict code in LSSetAppointmentCommand and 
  LSNewAppointmentCommand!

- LSAppointmentProposalCommand needs a LOT of cleanup

- LSQueryAppointments needs more cleanup
