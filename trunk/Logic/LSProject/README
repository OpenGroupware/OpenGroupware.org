Project 'kind' is not really used in OGo. The SkyProjectDataSource can filter
on it, buts thats it. No (core) OGo component currently sets the kind.
'common', 'private' etc are "derived attributes" and not stored in the
table.

The is_fake field is used for auto-created projects associated with a company,
projects with this flag set are hidden in the regular OGo project app.
