OGoLDAPClientUI
===============

This was done as a small example for LDAP integration back in summer 2001.
It basically seems to be a ripoff of the project viewer panel.

Might be interesting for some people, maybe it inspires somewhat to write a
more complete and working LDAP frontend for OGo.

Beware: the coding style is pretty much mixed up, do not use as an example
        for that.

Bugs
====
- apparently the tree is broken?
- searching for firstname doesn't work?
probably a lot more ;-)

Configuration
=============

You need to set two defaults:
  LdapViewer_Host     (eg ldap.skyrix.com)
  LdapViewer_Base     (eg dc=skyrix,dc=com)
  LdapViewer_User     (eg 'donald')
  LdapViewer_Password (eg 'duck')
