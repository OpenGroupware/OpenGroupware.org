Intro
=====

This library contains Objective-C classes to support parse and encode
information contained in XmlSchema files. It also contains XmlSchema
driven coding/decoding code and a tool (createSchemaClasses) to create
a set of Objective-C files given a schema.

State
=====

Currently untested and probably in a messy state. A *lot* of warnings
are shown during compilation :-(
Maybe one can find out how to use it using xschema.m.
