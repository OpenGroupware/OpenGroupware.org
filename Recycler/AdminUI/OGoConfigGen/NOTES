Virtual Domains
===============
  All "other" (non-matching) mails to user xxx:
    @xml-rpc.de   hh@skyrix.com

  For refreshing virtual domains a 'postfix reload' is *not* sufficient,
  you also need to run 'postmap [virtual file]'!

  sendmail style vdomain
  ======================
  With a sendmail-style virtual domain, every local account exists in all of 
  the domains handled by Postfix. For example, if your mail server accepts 
  mail for example.net and example.com, and you have a local user tk19, then 
  mail to tk19@example.net and tk19@example.com will both be delivered to the 
  local user. This may not be what you want. If it isn't, then regular 
  postfix-style virtual domain may be what you need.

  This is an example of a sendmail-style virtual domain:
    dan@example.net dan
    dan@example.com tm
  With this scenario, mail sent to the unknown user dtm@example.com will be 
  delivered to the local user dtm. Mail to xyz@example.org will be bounced to 
  the sender if no local user xyz exists.

  regular postfix-style vdomain
  =============================
  The main difference between a sendmail-style virtual domain and a regular 
  postfix-style virtual domain is what I call the domain header (this is a 
  term I made up; don't expect to see it used elsewhere). This creates a 
  domain use name space. Local user names are not visible in a regular 
  postfix-style virtual domain.

    example.net      DOMAIN
    dan@example.net  dan

    example.com      DOMAIN
    dan@example.com  dtm

  With this example, mail for an unknown user in example.net will be bounced 
  back to the sender, unlike a sendmail-style virtual domain where delivery 
  will be first attempted to a local user before bouncing. For what it's 
  worth, this is the type of virtual domain I use on my mail servers.

Postfix Configuration - Basics
==============================
  http://www.postfix.org/basic.html

  "The Postfix sendmail program invokes the privileged postdrop program which 
   deposits the message into the maildrop directory, where the message is 
   picked up by the pickup daemon. This daemon does some sanity checks, in 
   order to protect the rest of the Postfix system"

Virtual File
============

       user@domain address, address, ...
              Mail  for  user@domain  is  redirected  to address.
              This form has the highest precedence.

       user address, address, ...
              Mail for user@site is redirected  to  address  when
              site  is equal to $myorigin, when site is listed in
              $mydestination,   or   when   it   is   listed   in
              $inet_interfaces.

              This  functionality  overlaps with functionality of
              the local aliases(5) database.  The  difference  is
              that  virtual  mapping  can be applied to non-local
              addresses.

       @domain address, address, ...
              Mail for  any  user  in  domain  is  redirected  to
              address.  This form has the lowest precedence.

    "admin_mailquota" = 100;

Team Defaults
=============

    "admin_vaddresses" = "testvirt@skyrix.com\ntest2virt@opengroupware.org\n";
