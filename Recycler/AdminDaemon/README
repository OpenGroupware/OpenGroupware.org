============

ATTENTION: the admin daemon will be removed from CVS, it has been replaced by 
           the new AdminUI section.


Defaults which need to be set ...
=================================
  "export data" 
  - in the MTA domain, to make the daemon export the MTA-info data (it will 
    just return "nil" otherwise.

  "MailConfigEnabled"
  - in the OpenGroupware domain, to enable the mail config interfaces in the 
    Admin WebUI application.
