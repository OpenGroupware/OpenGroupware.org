Invoice
=======
[EXPERIMENTAL]

The developer mailinglist asked for the Invoice application (someone discovered
the invoice database tables and wondered what they are good for ;-)

So here it is, it's not a very good example and not very good for managing
invoices, but have fun nevertheless !
Not all features might work with OGo, since Invoice was written for SKYRiX 3
and is pretty old.

If you need help on that, contact Martin at mh@opengroupware.org.

==============================================================================
What is OGo Invoices?

OGo Invoices is a software-bundle for managing articles, invoices, 
monitions and debitor-accounts in a company. It's based upon the 
OpenGroupware.org framework.
It has a web-interface, which is accessable from the OGo WebUI.

WARNING: The code is old and not used for a while. There might be some 
problems which issue from the integration of the bundle into the OGo 
environment.

Installation

After installing LSInvoice, SkyInvoice and SkyInvoiceLib you need to create
a team for all that should have access to your invoices. Manually the login 
of that team has to be changed to 'invoices' in the database. This isn't 
possible via the WebUI.

How to start?

To create invoices you need articles. To create articles you need 
article-categories and article-units. To create those click on the 'new'-button
in the 'articles' or the 'units'-tab in the invoice app. After creating
an article you can start creating invoices. Debitor can be any enterprise
in your OGo. The syntax for the article area is: 

articleRow:   <articleNr> ":" <articleCount> 
              [ ":" <additionalComment> [":" <alternativePrice> ] ]


Bugs/Problems

- The dock-icon is missing.
- There seems to be a problem with the postgreSQL adaptor when there are NULL 
  values in the double/float fields.
