Project Login Redirector
========================

This is a simple application which sits in front of a set of OGo instances. It
displays a login window and if that is successful a set of all projects from
all instances. A click on a project leads the user to the appropriate instance
without and additional login.

Login are checked and projects are retrieved using the XML-RPC daemon.


Configuration
=============

You need to map the XML-RPC server to the WebUI application URL.

PLRClientMap = {
  "http://skyrix.in.skyrix.com/RPC2" = "https://skyrix.in.skyrix.com/Skyrix5";
  "http://localhost:23000/RPC2"      = "http://move:9000/OpenGroupware";
}
