- split this bundle!
  - it contains *24* components, should be about 3 bundles
    - filtering/vacation support could go into an own bundle [done]
    - mailing lists could go into an own bundle
    - printing could go into an own bundle

- replace the component confict (ccfg in English.lproj) with
  something better if possible (eg CSS, defaults, ...)

- find out difference between SkyImapMailDataSource and NGImap4DataSource?

- SkyImapContextHandler
  - replace login and host data with NSURL objects!
    - need to fix libFoundation's NSURL first ... (doesn't accept login data)
