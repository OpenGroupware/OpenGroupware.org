# $Id$

- split this bundle!
  - it contains *24* components, should be about 3 bundles
    - filtering/vacation support could go into an own bundle
    - mailing lists could go into an own bundle
    - printing could go into an own bundle

- replace the component confict (ccfg in English.lproj) with
  something better if possible (eg CSS, defaults, ...)

- find out difference between SkyImapMailDataSource and NGImap4DataSource?

- SkyImapContextHandler
  - replace login and host data with NSURL objects!
    - need to fix libFoundation's NSURL first ... (doesn't accept login data)

- LSWImapMailEditor
  - this needs SERIOUS cleanup
    - has *3200* lines, almost 100KB in size
      - update: we are already down to 2700 lines :-)
    - methods with hundreds of lines
    - loads of duplicate code
  - should probably be refactored to have a "mail construction object" which
    deals with all the attachments etc
