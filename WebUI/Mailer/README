Mailer
======

This directory contains the packages which form the OpenGroupware.org
IMAP4 based webmail application.

OGoWebMail
==========
- IMAP4 based web mailer, uses the NGMime library from SOPE/skyrix-core

OGoMailViewers
==============
- OGoWebMail uses a component based system to display MIME mails, the
  OGoMailViewers bundle contains the basic ones for displaying MIME
  parts, text-parts etc

OGoMailInfo
===========
- separate bundle for the mail dock-icon (so that we don't need to load
  the full mailer if it isn't used)

LSWMail
=======
- this contained the old RDBMS based application, OGoWebMail still uses
  some components from this
=> TODO: move all required things to OGoWebMail (or a new bundle)
