User Manager Application
========================

Note: in case you wonder that there is no LSWAccountEditor - this is the
      LSWPreferencesEditor in PreferencesUI ...

Note: apparently the LSWAccountViewer is not the viewer for accounts?
      => apparently LSWPreferencesViewer is used for that?
TODO: is the LSWAccountViewer actually used somewhere?

Note: the 'nickname' is stored in the 'description' field in the database
