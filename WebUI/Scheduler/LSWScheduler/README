LSWScheduler
============

This contains "pretty old" components, coming from about SKYRiX 3.5. Since some
of them are pretty complex and hard to rewrite from scratch, they are still
used ;-)
One limitation is that most of the components in here work on EO objects
instead of GID commands.


NOTES
=====

SkyParticipantsSelection
========================
- used in: SkyPalmPreferences, LSWAppointmentProposal, LSWSchedulerPreferences,
           LSWAppointmentEditor
- Note: LSWProjectEditor has its own mechanism for doing that ...

SkyParticipantsSelection
========================
- used by: LSWAppointmentEditor, LSWAppointmentProposal, 
           LSWSchedulerPreferences
- must be embedded in a <table> (generates tr tags)

Sample:
---snip---
AccountSelection: SkyParticipantsSelection {
  participants         = participants;
  selectedParticipants = selectedParticipants;
  onlyAccounts         = NO;
  viewHeadLine         = NO;
  headLineLabel        = "searchPopupEntries";
  searchLabel          = "searchPopupEntries";
  selectionLabel       = "choosePopupEntries";
}
---snap---
