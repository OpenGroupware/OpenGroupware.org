Todolist for LSWScheduler
=========================

- need a lot of refacturing, mostly some reused objects for common edit
  operations, like setting up a mail editor. There is a lot of duplicated
  code in here.

LSWSchedulerPreferences
  This is *extremely* mixed up and needs a LOT of cleanup and refacturing.

LSWAppointmentViewer
  Which template is used? It contains a template in the root .wo but also
  an English.lproj one. Then the German.lproj does not seem to be a derived
  template?

LSWAppointmentEditor
  The AppointmentEditor really needs a lot of cleanup work! It's huge, doesn't
  use reusable components etc ...

LSWAppointmentMove
  needs a lot of code cleanup
  a lot of duplicate code with the editor?

The mail template code seems to be copied in various places! reorganize 
implementation!

The printviewer even states that it is a copy of the appointment viewer - sigh

The appointment-type processing code contains a lot of DUPs.
