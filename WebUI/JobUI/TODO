- cleanups, cleanups, cleanups ..
- is LSWJobImport still usable/being used?
- some duplicate code in all viewers?
  - analyse!
  - eg: jobUrl!!

- it would be nice to have a job status object which knows about the
  available transitions
  => done?

- links in taskviewer should be 'activate' links

- find out what "waste jobs" are (see LSWJobs.m)

- fix own URL generation in LSWJobAction.m to use some generic method

- LSWJobViewer
  - replace LSWTableView with SkyTableView in history list

- LSWJobViewer / LSWJobAction
  - create a reusable component which renders the task info for both
