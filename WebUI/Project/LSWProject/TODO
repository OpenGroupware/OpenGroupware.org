- LSWProjectEditor
  - currently doesn't use a component for projectlead and access list selection
    functionality (which s***s big time)
  - SkyParticipantsSelection in LSWScheduler might be a replacement?

- SkyProjectSelection
  - should list favorite projects!

- remove unused components, most (all?) things are covered by OGoProject now !
  - "LSWProjects"       used by SkyNote
  - "LSWProjectJobList" used by SkyProject4Viewer, LSWProjectViewer

- still used fully by OGoProject:
  - LSWProjectEditor !

- LSWDocumentViewer
  - used by: ???
  - still bound to 'eo/doc' 'view'

- LSWProjectWizard
  - needs cleanup
