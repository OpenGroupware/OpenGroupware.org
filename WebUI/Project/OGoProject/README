Viewer Lookup
=============

Inline viewers are handled by the SkyProject4BLOBViewer component which is a
shell for additional, embedded viewers.

To lookup an embedded viewer, the component uses an NGBundleManager query with
the document MIME-type on the 'docview-inline' verb. If no component was found,
the 'mailview' verb is tried (which uses the components intended for the web
mailer).
If all this fails, the BLOB viewer finally checks whether the content is plain
text content and tries to find a plaintext viewer.

Some products which provide docview inline viewers:
  OGoDocInlineViewers
  OGoProjectZip
Products which provide mailview inline viewers:
  PersonsUI, EnterprisesUI
  JobUI
  LSWProject
  LSWMail, OGoWebMail, OGoMailViewers
  LSWScheduler
Note that most of the mail viewers are for displaying eo-pkey MIME types 
(referred objects) which do not occure in project documents.

After activation docview inline viewers get the following information set via
KVC (if available):
  'filename'    - the path to the document (relative to the filemanager)
  'fileManager' - the NSFileManager object providing access to the file
  'uri'         - a URL to retrieve the BLOB of the document
If mail viewers are used for displaying document content, this information is
not passed to the viewer.
