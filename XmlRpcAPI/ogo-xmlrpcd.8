.SH HISTORY
The XML-RPC interface was introduced in SKYRiX 4.1 as a language agnostic
way to script the groupware functionality. It replaced the previously used
Python/ObjC interface which was difficult to set up, insecure and bound to
a specific language (Python).
The xmlrpcd server opened OGo for almost any programming language available.
