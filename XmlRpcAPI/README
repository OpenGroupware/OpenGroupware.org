XmlRpcAPI (v1)
==============

The OpenGroupware.org project includes a full features XML-RPC API. This
directory contains the XML-RPC server and will contain some wrappers for
various languages.

Note: the XML-RPC API as available will stay and not change for the foreseeable 
future. But you may want to check out the SandStorm servers or ZideStore, which
both provide a bit easier API (but are less stable from an API point of view).
