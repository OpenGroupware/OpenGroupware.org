XML-RPC Daemon
==============

The OpenGroupware.org project includes a full features XML-RPC API. This
directory contains the XML-RPC server and will contain some wrappers for
various languages.

Note: the XML-RPC API as available will stay and not change for the foreseeable 
future. But you may want to check out the SandStorm servers or ZideStore, which
both provide a bit easier API (but are less stable from an API point of view).

TODO: write much more

Note: there is an API PDF document available on the docs website.

General Works
=============

All methods are attached to a single direct action object. Most of them use
DocumentAPI internally to execute operations and directly encode/decode
document objects in XML-RPC.

Available Fault Codes
=====================

XMLRPC_FAULT_INVALID_PARAMETER 1
XMLRPC_FAULT_MISSING_PARAMETER 2
XMLRPC_FAULT_MISSING_CONTEXT   3
XMLRPC_FAULT_INVALID_RESULT    4
XMLRPC_FAULT_INTERNAL_ERROR    5
XMLRPC_FAULT_LOCK_ERROR        6
XMLRPC_MISSING_PERMISSIONS     7
XMLRPC_FAULT_NOT_FOUND         404
