SQLite
======

WORK IN PROGRESS

Database schema for SQLite database:

  http://www.sqlite.org/

Would be quite useful for extremely rapid setup, without the requirement
for an external database server.

Conversion Issues
=================

comments:
- SQLite comments are C-style "/* */", not # as in FrontBase

domains (custom types):
- SQLite doesn't support domains (CREATE DOMAIN)
  - we don't care, this is mapped in the model anyway ...

views:
- SQLite doesn't support writable views - what to do about that?
  - mostly affects company table
- either we create separate tables (probably problematic, even though
  SQLite has no constraints anyway)
  - problematic because we have joins between company and date for example
- or we make all writes go directly to the company table
  - need to hack code for that
  ^^^ this is probably the way to go

alter table
- not supported by SQLite
- tables need to be dropped and recreated

constraints
- no foreign key constraints
- check constraints are not evaluated

primary sequence
- well, how to do that? maybe we can use AUTOINCREMENT fields
- or we generate IDs in the app ...
