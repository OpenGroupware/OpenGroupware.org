- move all products to Products subdirectory to avoid confusion

- add Sybase related fixes from the SKYRiX 5 CVS

- deletes
  - perform deletes in backend !

- Task
  support for Evo comments on creation - evo uses it's own ID for the
  comment-PUT instead of the result of the prior PROPPATCH
  - also for contact comments ??

- Check the access permission settings
  A lot of stuff is set to "authenticated" in SOPE, so it might be
  possible to mount folders of other people (Note that you can never
  access private data, since the command objects of the Logic layer
  check the permissions)

- replace NSDictionary return values from backend with concrete
  classes ! (eg SxPersonRecord as result of SxContactManager instead
  of a generic NSDictionary)

- make SxFolder set-based query-processor selection even more convenient
  (provide a sequence of SetName->selector mappings)

- add change notification for Evo Ex Connector (periodical httpu triggers)

- need some idea on how to improve folder access on MacOSX. it currently
  issues about a request per folder entry which tends to break if you only
  have something like 2000 entries in your folder.
  probably generate a single vcard, single ical file on OSX Finder, maybe
  other desktop WebDAV clients as well.
