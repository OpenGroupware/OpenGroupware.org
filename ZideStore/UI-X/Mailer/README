SOGO Mailer UI
==============

- own (Thunderbird styled) frame
- component for tree

TODO
====
- a lot ;->
- SOPE: does not recognize <input type="button"> !

Components
==========
UIxMailAccountView.wox
UIxMailAccountsView.wox
UIxMailEditor.wox
UIxMailToSelection.wox
UIxMailListView.wox
UIxMailMainFrame.wox
UIxMailTree.wox
UIxMailView.wox

Defaults
========

SOGoShowInternetMarker - bool
- show a marker in the editor that the request is from the outside

SOGoInternetDetectQualifier - string
- an EOQualifier to detect whether a set of HTTP headers is from the outside,
  eg: "NOT (minequprovenance = 'intranet')"
      -SOGoInternetDetectQualifier '"NOT (minequprovenance = \"intranet\")"'
  Note: all header field names are lowercase

SOGoInternetMailHeaders - dictionary
- if a request was detected as coming from the Internet, add the mail headers
  specified in this default
  eg: { received = "sogo depuis internet"; }
  -SOGoInternetMailHeaders "{received=\"sogo depuis internet\"; }"

SOGoMailEditorKeepTmpFile
- for debugging, if a mail was send, keep the file containing the MIME in the
  temporary directory for review instead of deleting it

Notes
=====

- we might want to bind the content viewers as SOPE methods to the mail class?
  eg "viewTextPlain"
  - this would not return a WOComponent, but a SoPageInvocation
  - caching might be more difficult 
    - some 'reuse component' support in SoPageInvocation for stateless
      components?
      - watch nested calls
  - for this we would need to add support for embedded calling of SOPE methods
    <var:component method="viewTextPlain" /> ?

Bodystructures
==============

Multiparts: multipart/MIXED, multipart/SIGNED

Feature: we fetch all plain/text bodies in a single run by traversing the
         body structure.

Sample Bodystructure (GPG):
---snip---
  {
    parts = (
        {
            bodyId = ""; 
            description = ""; 
            encoding = "QUOTED-PRINTABLE"; 
            lines = 22; 
            parameterList = {}; 
            size = 731; 
            subtype = PLAIN; 
            type = text; 
        }, 
        {
            bodyId = ""; 
            description = "Esta parte del mensaje"; 
            encoding = 7BIT; 
            parameterList = {name = "signature.asc"; }; 
            size = 196; 
            subtype = "PGP-SIGNATURE"; 
            type = application; 
        }
    ); 
    subtype = SIGNED; 
    type = multipart; 
  }
---snap---

Sample Body Structure (Image):
---snip---
  {
    parts = (
        {
            bodyId = ""; 
            description = ""; 
            encoding = BASE64; 
            parameterList = {name = "PoseChau.jpg"; "x-unix-mode" = 0644; }; 
            size = 58370; 
            subtype = JPEG; 
            type = image; 
        }, 
        {
            bodyId = ""; 
            description = ""; 
            encoding = 7BIT; 
            lines = 2; 
            parameterList = {charset = "US-ASCII"; format = flowed; }; 
            size = 57; 
            subtype = PLAIN; 
            type = text; 
        }
    ); 
    subtype = MIXED; 
    type = multipart; 
  }
