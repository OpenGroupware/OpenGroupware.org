- can't we use SOPE OFS for doing most of this?!
  - currently we have quite some code duplication because we inherit from
    ZideStore core objects (SxObject and SxFolder). For "usual" ZideStore
    objects those are really separate entities, but in the case of projects
    documents and folders are pretty similiar ...

- check whether everything is properly committed!
  - the OGo database based filemanager backend is transactional! which 
    implies that if you do not commit, you won't get your changes applied ...

- the ProjectsFolder should be able to create new, private projects using
  "mkcol"!

- moved on Finder:
  - need to implement move for that ...
  MKCOL    blah/untitled%20folder   201
  PROPFIND blah/untitled%20folder   207
  PROPFIND blah/._untitled%20folder 404 (resource forks)
  PROPFIND blah/._untitled%20folder 404 
  PROPFIND blah/myfolder            404
  PROPFIND blah/myfolder            404
  MOVE     blah/untitled%20folder   403
  - why doesn't OSX store resource forks in WebDAV properties?

- only show "favorite" projects at root level
  - too many projects at the root

- support for:
  - DELETE
  - PUT
  - PROPPATCH

- MKCOL does not work yet

- locking
  - lock/unlock WebDAV methods
  - lock tokens?
  - maybe even support WebDAV checkin/checkout?
  - add a workaround for not-checkin aware clients (eg a "checkin" folder)
  - Remember: we need to work around the issue that most Windows apps have an 
    "autosave" feature which will PUT a file every x minutes - so we cannot
    create a new version on each save!
  - Method: "davLockManagerInContext:" - concrete implementation should use
    the backend's method of locking

- support for attributes
  - project attributes
  - document attributes

- speed
  - tune the caching mechanisms
  - implement the UA specialized methods for fetches
    - projects-folder
  - maybe use datasources for fetching collections

- DASL
  - implement DASL, should be possible to some degree in DB projects
    - even flat searches on a project are possible

- how do WebDAV ACLs work? implement if appropriate
