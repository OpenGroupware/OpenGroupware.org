ZideStore Support for OGo Projects
==================================

STATUS: in active development, versioning/changelog not yet active!

Intended Hierarchy:

donald
\- Projects		SxProjectsFolder (maybe contain SxProject's as contacts?)
  \- MyProject		SxProjectFolder
  |  +- Tasks		SxTaskFolder
  |  +- Notes		?
  |  +- Participants	SxContactFolder (accounts + teams)
  |  +- Contacts	SxContactFolder (related contacts)
  |  \- Documents	SxDocumentFolder
  |     +- SubFolder	SxDocumentFolder
  |     \- MyImage.gif	SxDocument
  \ MyOtherProject

We'll try to start out with raw document access.

Which projects are visible? For now, all projects, but this *MUST* be limited, 
eg the dock and/or favorite projects might be a useful subset.

And how do we reach projects associated with a company record?
