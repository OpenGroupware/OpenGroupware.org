Blogger
=======

Attempt to implement the Blogger XML-RPC API for ZideStore.


Root Methods vs Context Methods
===============================

Note that we could define the methods on the application object, because the
API has no concept of object traversal.
All the methods get a parameter specifing the blog and user in question.

Currently this isn't done because there can be quite a lot of blogs in OGo for
one user (especially in project contexts).

TODO
====
- authentication should be done via XML-RPC, not via basic auth

What Ecto Does
==============

1. XML-RPC: bloggers.getUsersBlogs
2. on each blog URL: GET
3. metaWeblog.getRecentPosts
4. mt.supportedTextFilters
5. mt.getCategoryList
