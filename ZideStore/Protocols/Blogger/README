Blogger
=======

Attempt to implement the Blogger XML-RPC API for ZideStore.

Note: this is far from being complete! It currently can list project notes in
      Ecto. Use a URL like:
        http://localhost/zidestore/so/donald/Projects/DBTEST/
      this will show the "Documents" and "Notes" BLOGs.


Root Methods vs Context Methods
===============================

Note that we could define the methods on the application object, because the
API has no concept of object traversal.
All the methods get a parameter specifing the blog and user in question.

Currently this isn't done because there can be quite a lot of blogs in OGo for
one user (especially in project contexts).


NOTES
=====
- blogger.deletePost does not specify the blog, only the post id


TODO
====
- authentication should be done via XML-RPC, not via basic auth

What Ecto Does
==============

MovableType Mode
1. XML-RPC: bloggers.getUsersBlogs
2. on each blog URL: GET
3. metaWeblog.getRecentPosts
4. mt.supportedTextFilters
5. mt.getCategoryList

Note: Ecto does not escape '>':
---snip---
	<member>
		<name>description</name>
		<value><string>&lt;p>
mein &lt;strong>content&lt;/strong> 1
&lt;/p></string></value>
	</member>

Ecto currently throws exceptions:

Atom
====

Not currently implemented. First we need "X-Wsse" authentication:
---snip---
X-Wsse: UsernameToken Username="helge", 
        PasswordDigest="lmay9ZhN0/RmchYJhuf1jQT3E50=", 
        Nonce="ZWN0by0zNzI3", 
        Created="2004-10-24T14:37:27Z"
