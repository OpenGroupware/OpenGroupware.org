Google GData API Support for ZideStore
======================================

NOTE: this is just playstuff, don't use it ;-) Patches are welcome ;-)

TODO: document

* Apache Config

<LocationMatch "^/accounts/ClientLogin*">
SetAppPort 21010
SetHandler ngobjweb-adaptor
</LocationMatch>

<LocationMatch "^/calendar/feeds/*">
SetAppPort 21010
SetHandler ngobjweb-adaptor
</LocationMatch>


* PUT/DELETE vs POST handling

- this is implemented in SOPE


* Login

URL: /accounts/ClientLogin

- the URL is hardcoded in GoogleService.java?
  service = new GoogleService("cl", /* calendar */
                              "exampleCo-myApp-1", /* app-id",
                              "http",
			      "myhost:myport");

- the Login action is in the GDataAccounts SoObject which is mapped to
  /accounts in products.plist


* Calendar feeds

Default URL: /calendar/feeds/$user/private/full

- we support the default URL scheme, though we can also instruct the Google
  Java API to use a different URL for a feed
- /calendar       is mapped to GCalEntryPoint in products.plist
- /calendar/feeds is passed through by GCalEntryPoint (returns the same object)


Notes:
- when GETing a feed, the Java API sets an Accept header which prefers
  text/html
  - the request content-type is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded
