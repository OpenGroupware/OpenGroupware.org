1)  * install - if not already done - your favorite postgresql-server port
      (*only required* if the database should be on this host)

    * make sure that the postgresql database is ready to use
      (refer to the servers documentation)

2)  * the following commands should be executed on the host where
      the OpenGroupware database should be installed/run

      a)  substitude user identity to the user PostgreSQL runs as:
          (implies that you're 'root')

          $ su - pgsql

      b)  define a new PostgreSQL user account named 'OGo':

          $ createuser -A -D OGo

      c)  create a new PostgreSQL database named 'OGo' using
          the encoding 'LATIN1' and the owner should be the user
          we've just created:

          $ createdb -E LATIN1 -O OGo OGo

      d)  connect to the database we've created as user 'OGo' and
          load the pg-build-schema.psql:

          $ psql OGo OGo

          This will beam you into the servers shell:

          Welcome to psql <version>, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

          Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
                 \h for help with SQL commands
                 \? for help with psql commands
                 \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
                 \q to quit

          OGo=> 

          where 'OGo=>' is your current prompt.

          To load the scheme - enter the following command:

          OGo=> \i %%PREFIX%%/lib/opengroupware.org-%%OGO_VERSION%%/commands/OGo.model/Resources/pg-build-schema.psql

          ... and this command should finish within some seconds without any errors.

          (The same can be done completely on the commandline - refer to psql(1) for
          the options needed and make sure to connect as user 'OGo' if you prefer doing
          it this way.)

      e)  leave the PostgreSQL shell:

           OGo=> \q

          ... and switch back to the 'root' user:

          $ exit

3)  * done - you are now ready to use OpenGroupware

4)  * restart/start the OpenGroupware webinterface:

        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ogo-webui restart    -or-
        /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ogo-webui start

      (requires certain variables in /etc/rc.conf)
