This port installs the required GNUstep OGo environment in order
to compile the OpenGroupware.org suite.

You might want to check the original 'gnustep-make' port if this
is not what you want.

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.
