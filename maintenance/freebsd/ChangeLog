2007-04-02 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* switch default apache port to www/apache22
	* minor adjustments in mod_ngobjweb/

2007-03-26 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* don't strip
	* properly deorbit files installed by sope-devel

2007-03-25 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* opengroupware-devel is r1910 now... and we deorbit stray dirs
	  here too...
	* sope-devel is r1467 now (remove stray dirs here as well)
	* cleanup ogo-libfoundation install stage
	  ... we now make sure that the 'Additional/' dir is present
	  prior installing and we also clean up stray files/dirs
	  leftover after moving things into FHS

2007-03-22 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* fixed pkg-plist files I'd broken (but still some woes in deinstall/reinstall)
	  wrt ogo-gnustep-make (Additional/ dir created by ogo-gnustep-make
	  but not populated by it... which _might_ run @dirrmtry into an undefined
	  stage on certain install/deinstall operations)

2007-03-20 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* bumped ogo-gnustep-make to version 1.13.0 (current stable)
	* ... as a result of this - major changes to all ports involved
	* added patch-aa to ogo-gnustep-make/files in order to fix compilation
	  on amd64 (for ports depending on ogo-gnustep-make)... it detected amd64
	  as x86_64 which isn't quite correct (since amd64 == amd64)
	* although we're still compiling with 'debug=yes'... the resulting libraries
	  are not labeled as '_d' in order to expose them as debug libraries...
	  and thus we now skip this label (see pkg-plist changes)
	* broke several pkg-plist entries due to my incompetence when it comes to
	  to substitute several '_d' entries with their new value... will fix this tomorrow :)

2007-03-14 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* refixed another 'deinstall' clash on directories created by ogo-gnustep-make
	  but populated by ogo-libfoundation
	* properly remove 'Tools/' and 'Library/' directory from ${PREFIX}
	* updated sope-devel to r1455 (which fixes compile wtf in NGVcard)
	* this is sope 4.7 now...
	* bumped opengroupware-devel to opengroupware.org-trunk-r1894-200703141503
	* deorbit pilot-link from build due to unforseen incompatiblities

2007-03-12 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* use @dirrmtry whereever required instead of 'old' method
	* deorbit opengroupware10
	* fixed directory removal clashes between ogo-gnustep-make vs. ogo-libfoundation
	* updated ogo-libfoundation to 'libfoundation-trunk-r162-200701261110.tar.gz' (1.1.5)
	* make ChangeLog more clear when it comes to deparse ogo-libfoundation changes

2006-08-01 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* fixed rc script redirection
	* fixed distinfo for mod_ngobjweb
	* use APACHE_PORT?= ...

2006-07-19 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* plist sub'ified pkg-plist 
	* adjust pkg-install.in

2006-07-11 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* several upcoming updates...
	* moved sope45-devel to sope-devel
	* bumped all versions to current trunk state
	* sope ports require BUILD_DEPENDS 'shells/bash'
	  because of the included 'configure' script
	  (which cannot be run by /bin/sh here)

2006-05-20 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* sope45-devel -> bumped to SVN r1263
	  deorbited all versions (most cases) from pkg-plist into Makefile
	  (and thus abusing PLIST_SUB heavily)

2006-04-22 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* ogo-libfoundation/files/patch-aa - explicitly backout usage
	  of recently exposed reentrant netdb.h functions,
	  because of (cited from http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/net/Symbol.map) which
	  in turn should lead you to ('http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/net/Symbol.map?rev=1.5&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup')

	* unbreak opengroupware10 port
	* fixed previous commit (accidently broke pkg-plist)
	* updated sources for mod_ngobjweb
	* unbreak mod_ngobjweb for apache21/apache22 installations

2006-04-18 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* temporarily break opengroupware10 until features were synced from opengroupware-devel
	  (to avoid that testers run into obvious issues)

2006-04-18 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* opengroupware-devel port -> added documentation (README_APACHE_SETUP.in/
	  README_POSTGRESQL_SETUP.in) with detailed instructions on how to finalize
	  the installation
	* changed pkg-install.in to not do anything if a previous setup was found
	* added pkg-message.in which points to the instructions mentioned above

2006-04-17 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* opengroupware-devel/Makefile -> fixed installation
	  issue where we ended up having symlinks pointing into our
	  WRKSRC in the final installation (introduced patch-aa)
	* opengroupware-devel/pkg-plist -> redone, honoring changes
	  introduced by patch-aa
	* opengroupware-devel/files/pkg-install.in -> started working
	  on initial setup (hm, almost complete)
	* opengroupware-devel/files/ogo-.*sh.*in$ -> use SUB_LIST/SUB_FILES
	  from toplevel Makefile in initscripts
	  (and pkill -9 now - otherwise the processes won't go away in the
	  stop case)

2006-04-16 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* mod_ngobjweb/Makefile -> update to honor apache21/22
	  (and bail out early if they are in use bc mod_ngobjweb
	  needs an update to work with these apache versions)

2006-04-14 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* svn'moved opengroupware to opengroupware10 in order
	  to distinguish upcoming releases (surprise, surprise :)!)

	* sope45-devel/Makefile -> added SHOW_MESSAGES condition
	* updated to more recent trunk (opengroupware-devel)
	* opengroupware-devel/Makefile -> added SHOW_MESSAGES condition
	* opengroupware-devel/Makefile -> proper usage of USE_RC_SUBR made portlint happy again
	* renamed 'files/rcng/(.*).sh' to 'files/rcng/$1.sh.in' (bc of USE_RC_SUBR usage)
	* moved rc.d scripts up into 'files/' (dropped directory 'rcng/')

	* updated to more recent trunk (opengroupware-devel)
	* synced Makefile features (opengroupware-devel)
	* bail out if SOPE build doesn't seem to be complete
	  (opengroupware/opengroupware-devel)

2005-11-15 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	  ${APXS} during 'make' (mod_ngobjweb)
	* updated all distinfo files to reflect changes announced with
	  OSVERSION 504102 (SHA256 checksums)
	* corrected opengroupware/opengroupware-devel Makefile and
	  set correct OSVERSION (600022) to depend on gtar from ports
	  when gtar was finally completely deorbited from base
	  (opengroupware/opengroupware-devel)
	* added important hint to 'README.EARLY_ADOPTORS' for users
	  testing this port on -CURRENT

	* politely ask in opengroupware/opengroupware-devel config,
	  if the (required) PostgreSQL server runs on the same host or not
	  (in order to inhale a dependency on postgresql${DEFAULT_PGSQL_VER}-server, or not)
