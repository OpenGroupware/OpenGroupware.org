2006-04-17 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* opengroupware-devel/Makefile -> fixed installation
	  issue where we ended up having symlinks pointing into our
	  WRKSRC in the final installation (introduced patch-aa)
	* opengroupware-devel/pkg-plist -> redone, honoring changes
	  introduced by patch-aa
	* opengroupware-devel/files/pkg-install.in -> started working
	  on initial setup (hm, almost complete)
	* opengroupware-devel/files/ogo-.*sh.*in$ -> use SUB_LIST/SUB_FILES
	  from toplevel Makefile in initscripts
	  (and pkill -9 now - otherwise the processes won't go away in the
	  stop case)

2006-04-16 Frank Reppin  <frank@opengroupware.org>

	* mod_ngobjweb/Makefile -> update to honor apache21/22

	  OSVERSION 504102 (SHA256 checksums)
	* corrected opengroupware/opengroupware-devel Makefile and

	* politely ask in opengroupware/opengroupware-devel config,
