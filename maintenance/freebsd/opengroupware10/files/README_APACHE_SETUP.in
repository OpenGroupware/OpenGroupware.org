1)  * install - if not already done - the 'apache' port
    * we recommend either

      /usr/ports/www/apache13   -or-
      /usr/ports/www/apache20

2)  * install the 'mod_ngobjweb' port from

      /usr/ports/www/mod_ngobjweb

      (this port will automatically depend on www/apache20
      if no apache was installed/found)

3)  * there are 3 sample configuration files in

      %%EXAMPLESDIR%%

      a)  ogo-webui-apache.conf
          (enables access via http to your OpenGroupware
          webinterface)

      b)  ogo-xmlrpcd-apache.conf
          (enables access via http to the OpenGroupware
          xmlrpc daemon)

      c)  ogo-zidestore-apache.conf
          (enables access via http to the OpenGroupware
          zidestore daemon)

    * these files must be included into you apache configuration

    * you don't need to edit anything in these files - they are ready to use

    * depending on what you want to do with your OpenGroupware
      installation - you might consider including all files (a to c),
      none or only selected ones for services you'll want to access via http

      (you'll most likely include at least the file 'ogo-webui-apache.conf')

4)  * copy the chosen file/files into your apache configuration 'Include/' directory
    * depending on the apache version you've installed - this could be (for example):

      /usr/local/etc/apache2/Include/    -or-
      /usr/local/etc/apache21/Include/

5)  * now restart apache using it's initscript (check /usr/local/etc/rc.d/)

6)  * in order to test connectivity - start your favorite webbrowser and
      point it to:

      http://<your.server.tld>/OpenGroupware
        (if you've installed ogo-webui-apache.conf)

      http://<your.server.tld>/RPC2
        (if you've installed ogo-xmlrpcd-apache.conf)

      http://<your.server.tld>/zidestore/so/<username>
        (if you've installed ogo-zidestore-apache.conf)
