STATUS:
========

  * general TODO:

    make it autoconfig everything required depending on if
    it's an upgrade or a fresh install

    mod_ngobjweb/files/patch-ab is broken... (needs to be fixed)
    if used with apache13 [for instance] /zidestore gives NSURL
    errors ala:

    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [01/Aug/2006:16:46:18 GMT] "GET /zidestore/so/http(s)://current.undermydesk.org:80

  * give README/HOWTO covering the process to move
    the old port to the new one

  * Joe Auty <joe at netmusician dot org> was so kind to test and
     reported:

    port: opengroupware/opengroupware-devel
    error: portsdb/pkgdb complains about the
           portversion/portrevision 'not in due',
           so we have to rework the versioning scheme
           for at least this port
    problem: how to satisfy bsd.port.mk whilst maintaining
             most of the naming scheme OGo uses.
             The exact portversion/sources used to build the port
             should be visible using pkg_info (I really don't
             want a separate mapping FreeBSD versions vs OGo versions
             once a user hits the mailing list/bugzille reporting an
             issue). pkg_info should at least suggest whether $USER uses
             a release build (port: opengroupware) and which release
             sources were used... same for the trunk builds (port:
             opengroupware-devel).


    FIXED: but we lost the explicit versioning scheme in pkg_info
           in favour of making 'portlint' even more happy.
           I've dropped the idea of knowing the exact version reported
           by pkg_info bc we know what versions we've committed, and thus
           it shouldn't be hard to figure out.
