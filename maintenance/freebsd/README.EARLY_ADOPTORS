Whilst everything in here is already quite functional - this port collection
is still in an

  USE AT THY OWN RISK

stage.

Everything may change without further notice, rendering your installation
inaccesible or otherwise not useful as expected.

You've been warned.

HOWTO:
=========

Simply checkout everything from, freebsd/
and copy it to:

   /usr/port/devel/

Run your favourite 'make' target from within'
the portsdir of what you intend to build, the
required dependencies should be resolved automatically.

(Once alive - the port won't reside in devel/
alone - I may/will deorbit some parts to other groups according
to the ports-developer guidelines)

If you test this port using -CURRENT... please make sure
to link at least:

  ln -s 'j' /etc/malloc.conf
