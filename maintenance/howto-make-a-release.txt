- make sure you have a clean and current working copy:
    svn up
    svn stat

- 'make distclean' in your working copy

- Write a changes file in the 'maintenance' directory, eg:

     maintenance/changes-1.1.4-to-1.1.5.txt

  To assist that, run Contrib/compare-releases.py against the last release:

     ./Contrib/compare-releases.py \
       ~/dev/complete/OpenGroupware.org/releases/1.1.4-moveon \
       . \
       > maintenance/changes-1.1.4-to-1.1.5.txt 
  
  This walks all ChangeLog files and produces a summary which we include at
  the bottom of the changes file.
  
  In the changes file summarize the ChangeLog information a bit, see old files
  for examples.

  Don't forget to add the changes to the repository:

    svn add maintenance/changes-1.1.4-to-1.1.5.txt

- Commit all changes in the prerelease

  svn commit

- Tag the prerelease as a release

  REP="http://developer.opengroupware.org/OpenGroupware.org"
  REL="${REP}/releases/1.1.5-moveon"

  svn cp -m "tagged OGo 1.1.5" ${REP}/trunk ${REL}

- Be sure to remove unnecessary things from the release

  svn rm -m "removed Recycler from release" ${REL}/Recycler
  svn rm -m "removed non-release directories from release" ${REL}/Migration
  svn rm -m "removed non-release directories from release" ${REL}/Misc
  svn rm -m "removed non-release directories from release" ${REL}/Contrib
