Migration / SLEMS3
==================

Scripts which allow you to migrate the contacts, scheduler and tasks
databases of an SuSE Linux Email Server 3.x to the OpenGroupware.org
database.

NOTE: This cannot be used to migrate a SLOX installation to OGo since
      SLOX - unlike SLEMS - uses an obfuscated and undocumentated
      database scheme - and isn't OpenSource either.

The export scripts dump out the information contained in SLEMS 3 into
the filesystem while the import scripts load that info into OGo.
