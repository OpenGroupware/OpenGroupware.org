SKYRiX Master Daemon
Troubleshooting Guide

1.   Required Tools

2.   Startup
2.1. The masterd starts up, but it doesn't load any templates.
2.2. The masterd starts up, but no tasks get autostarted.
2.3. The masterd won't register at the started registry at startup.

3.   Working With The Daemon
3.1. I can't perform XML-RPC calls which require authentication.
3.2. The script skydaemon.rc doesn't seem to work, what's wrong ?

4.   Misc
4.1. Where is the README for this daemon ?
4.2. Where is the installation guide for this daemon ?
4.3. Where is the troubleshooting guide for this daemon ?

1.   Required Tools
===================
Before you try to find errors in your configuration, check that you
have installed the latest version of the daemon itself and the tools
used for controlling the daemon.
So go, check out and build

  - Daemons/SkyIDL
  - Daemons/skymasterd
  - Core/NGXmlRpc
  - Core/SxComponents
  - install/

2.   Startup
============

2.1. The masterd starts up, but it doesn't load any templates.
==============================================================
Have you already set any templates ? Check $GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT/skymasterd.xml
if you want to define all the templates in one file or
$GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT/skymasterd/ if you use single files for every template.

2.2. The masterd starts up, but no tasks get autostarted.
=========================================================
Check $GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT/skymasterd-instances.xml if you defined any instances
that should be autostarted. If there are any, check if the Default
SMPerformAutostart is set to NO, set it to YES to enable the autostart feature
(it's set to YES by default, so normally you don't need to set anything here).
If you don't use skymasterd-instances.xml but seperate instance config files,
be sure they reside in $GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT/config/skymasterd-instances, 
otherwise the daemon won't find them.

2.3. The masterd won't register at the started registry at startup.
===================================================================
In most cases this problem is caused by a wrong WOPort setting in the registry
instance file $GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT/config/skymasterd-instances/iRegistry.xml.

Change the WOPort section to match at least the port setting of your
SxComponentRegistryURL default (e.g. if your registry port is 21000, it should
look like the example below).

--snip--

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<instance uid="registryd" templateclass="skyregistryd"
          xmlns="http://www.skyrix.com/od/skymasterd-config">
  <priority>10</priority>
  <parameter name="WOPort">
    <value>*:21000</value>
  </parameter>
</instance>

--snap--

3.   Working With The Daemon
============================

3.1. I can't perform XML-RPC calls which require authentication.
================================================================
Obviously you didn't set the defaults SMAuthenticationUser and
SMAuthenticationPassword, which are required to process the authentication.
Choose a username/password combination, create a crypted password with:

  htpasswd -nb <user> <password>

and set the Defaults with

  Defaults write skymasterd SMAuthenticationUser <username>
  Defaults write skymasterd SMAuthenticationPassword <crypted-password>

3.2. The script skydaemon.rc doesn't seem to work, what's wrong ?
=================================================================
In most cases your skyregistryd daemon setup has errors, cause skydaemon.rc
uses the SandStorm component API to query for the status of the daemons.
Check the settings of your registry (ports, hosts, namespaces) in 
$GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT/config/skyregistryd.plist.

4.   Misc
=========

4.1. Where is the README for this daemon ?
==========================================
It resides in Daemons/skymasterd/README or in the SKYRiX intranet.

4.2. Where is the installation guide for this daemon ?
======================================================
It resides in Daemons/skymasterd/INSTALL or in the SKYRiX intranet.

4.3. Where is the troubleshooting guide for this daemon ?
=========================================================
