OpenGroupware.org SandStorm Environment
=======================================
[EXPERIMENTAL]
[REQUIRES: SOPE, GDL, Logic]

NOTE: EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE !!!

Software contained in the SandStorm section is incomplete and far from done.
Work on it is stopped in favor of ZideStore.

Update 2004-04-05
=================

Most parts of the environment where patched to compile with OGo, libXmlSchema
was moved into SandStorm for that.
The libXmlSchema library needs a review whether its good enough for inclusion 
in  skyrix-xml.

The general, but not immediate, plan is to drop SandStorm as an environment 
but save all the work which went into improving the XML-RPC API of OGo.


==============================================================================
This directory contains all kinds of "backend" daemons originally intended
for SKYRiX 4.2.

To access the Python examples (located in the py subdirectories) you
need a modified Python XML-RPC library which supports HTTP basic
authentication. You can find such a library in ThirdParty/pyxmlrpc.

TBD: the daemons should be bundles which can run inside of an
WOApplication "container" (as a WOApp, as an Apache bundle, ...)

Daemons:

  skytaskd (bs)
    - almost ready
    - start other daemons and track their state
    - used by skyregistryd for the component autostart feature

  skyregistryd (bs)
    - ready
    - is a "nameservice" for SandStorm components
    - TBD: autostarting components
    - TBD: UDDI Interface ??? (makes sense ???)

  skyaccountd (bs ?)
    - not ready
    - authorization and account/group information

  skycontactd (bs ?)
    - not ready
    - contact info (persons, enterprises, addresses)

  skydbd (bs)
    - ready
    - SQL processing, adaptor operations
  
  skyjobd (bs ?)
    - not ready
    - job processing (todo lists etc)

  skymaild (ga)
    - not ready
    - mail sending/receiving
    - bulk mailing
    - mail templates

  skysystemd (bs)
    - ready
    - mapping Unix shell commands/scripts to XML-RPC actions

  skytrackd (bs)
    - ready ?
    - tracking changes off projects
    - TBD: tracking changes of all other SKYRIX objects
    - TBD: tracking changes on webpages
